# Turn-Based-RPG-Script-Presentations
A few scripts to serve as a testament to what I can make. This is only 4 scripts of the unfinished project's core system scripts, though some of the most important ones.

THE PROJECT IS CURRENTLY UNFINISHED, AND IT WILL PROBABLY REMAIN UNFINISHED AS IT'S TOO LARGE-SCALE OF A PROJECT TO COMPLETE ON MY OWN. I have made the project's entirety in about 2 months.

The game currently has, but is not limited to, these systems implemented by me & me alone:
Inventory, stat distribution, status ailments, buffs/debuffs, equipments, enemy mobs, active/passive skills, shopping, crafting, multiple save files, skill trees, NPCs & dialogue, items that can be used in and out of battles, player party system, weapon holstering, QTEs, and more.
NOT EVERY SYSTEM IS VIEWABLE IN THE GAME SINCE THE GAME IS UNFINISHED, but the game can be viewed on this roblox page:

You can also view some of my other games on my Roblox profile page, which is over here:

Do note that most of these games are older projects and not as finely crafted as the project I am presenting here (Untitled game), but I still think they are nice projects to have, and they are at least in playable, semi-finished states. In total, my projects have accumulated a total of over 400,000 visits by various players on the Roblox platform, and I have no regrets on the time I spent on these.
Thanks!
